## Summary and final findings

Based on the sentimental analysis using the VADER method, it was possible to subordinate the estimated sentiment, i.e. neutral, positive or negative. The levels selected by the Author suggest a strong advantage of Tweets with a predicted negative nature, but it may result, among others, from with high levels fixed for positive. On the other hand, the advantage of the ratio of negative tweets to the total in the case of #Trump over the same ratio in the case of #Biden tweets, the author leaves for free interpretation.

When the timeline is superimposed on the sentimental analysis, as a result of the visual analysis, it is argued that external factors may influence the share of negative Tweets in total. The superimposition of the election dates on the president of the United States and the dates of disclosure of the 'Swing States' are only a visual device of the Author and it is not stated that these events have an unequivocal influence on the studied variable.

Changes in social relations and aggressiveness in communication over time may highlight the use of political narratives in the timeline of the presidential elections.

Bearing in mind the works of other authors, that public opinion can be directed and is guided by the behavior and opinions of politicians, one can try to prove that the moods of voters of individual parties are analogous or correlated with the moods accompanying the parties themselves.
